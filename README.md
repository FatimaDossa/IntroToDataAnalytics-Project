In the fast-paced university environment, students contend with numerous obligations, from part-time work to demanding coursework, which frequently leaves them with little time for adequate sleep. 
This study examines the connection between undergraduate students' academic performance and sleep duration in Pakistani universities. We investigate the effect of sleep duration on students' 
Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) using both primary research—a questionnaire survey designed on Google Forms —and secondary research—a comprehensive literature analysis. 
Our results highlight the crucial role that getting adequate sleep plays in academic performance by showing a statistically significant link between sleep duration and CGPA backed by 
secondary research and the analysis of form responses.A closer look shows that while class attendance positively correlates with CGPA, there is no meaningful relationship between academic 
performance and other factors like social media use, exercise, and study hours. Our findings not only highlight the significance of encouraging students to adopt better sleeping practices, 
but they also provide important direction for evidence-based interventions that may improve students' overall academic performance in university setting.
